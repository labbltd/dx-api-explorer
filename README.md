This repository is a clone from the C++ implementation of the [DX API Explorer from Peter Bessman](https://github.com/BessmanPega/dx-api-explorer). In this clone the implementation is ported to a TypeScript and React implementation so that the tool can be made available online.

This app helps you understand [Pega's Constellation DX API](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/dx-api/page/platform/dx-api/dx-api-version-2-con.html) by showing it in action. It's a desktop application that let's you work through a [case](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/platform/page/platform/case-management/case-management-overview.html), providing detailed developer information so you know *exactly* what the DX API is doing every step of the way.
